# IBLT
## An Image-Based Language Translator
### or Incredible Bacon Lettuce Tomato

project for ENGI 7854: Image Processing and Applications

In progress by Matthew Pinsent and Chris Drury

## Dependancies:
IBLT will requires the following modules to run correctly:
1. Pillow      - For image enhancement
2. googletrans - For text translation
3. pytesseract - For communicating with Google's tesseract OCR

To install these, use the pip command.
As an example, to install Pillow:

    python -m pip install Pillow

4. Google's tesseract OCR is also needed and can be found for Windows devices here:
